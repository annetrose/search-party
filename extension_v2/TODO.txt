* BBB 9/8/12: Can't change Response & Note
  The first time it seems to get saved, but not afterwards.  The issue
  is that the process history isn't being updated.
  Also confused because I can't find the data in the appengine database

* BUG: Looking at background.html (from extension page), visits to "/student_token" URL don't exist

* Need to replace all deprecated uses of sendRequest with postMessage

* Page rating not restored if page is revisited
