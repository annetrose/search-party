need to specify timecut off for teacher starting new class
TODO: Clean up logging stuff
TODO: Test student login before teacher has set password
TODO: Test what happens when teachers log out when students still logged in
TODO: Figure out time zones
BUG:	Mouse over on search term with "+" in it doesn't work
TODO: Add teacher content filtering
TODO: Better aggregation
  - Tag cloud
  - Histogram
TODO: general visual design
TODO: Figure out what to put on home page when no one is logged in
TODO: Roll over teacher link should show search terms that got student there
DEPLOYMENT:
  - Let teacher log out individual, or all students
  - Let teacher remove student searches or links followed
  - Consider efficiency - i.e., make counting more efficient (i.e., cache count)
  - Consider security


Alex questions:
Q1.  It seems that teacher and student objects are stored twice, once in the DB
     and once in the session.  Is this true?


V2
 - Let teacher change their label ("search leader")
 - Let teacher time filter use range slider
 - Push visual indicator to student's view to identify inappropriate behavior
 - Add ability for teacher to see student's screens
 - Push teacher tasks to student view (different tasks per student?)
 - Replace search widget with custom search result display
 - Generalize architecture so other activities can be supported
 - Add polling/question activities with mobile web page/app support
 - Export data to spreadsheet
